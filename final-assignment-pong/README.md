# Pong Game

This is my final assignment for the Basic in Programming courses in LMU.

## Game Description

This version of the Pong game is inspired from a classic arcade-style video game. The game is a two-player game, and both players have to control their bats to keep the ball rallying and score as many points as possible until a player misses, terminating the game.

This game is built with a Java-based programming language Processing.
